    Expected output:
        Able to run the test file and have each line function as intended.

        test.pot:
        ```
        # This is a comment.
        count = 10
        say "The result of 'count' is: " count + 1
        say "throw an error here
        ```

        When that is done I can move on to the next version of the interpreter.

    What is next?
        Loops

        While loops are the first thing to start with.

# Spud Language

## Summary
Spud is an experimental programming language. Currently, it is a high-level
 interpreted language designed for ease of use. The long-term roadmap is to
 evolve Spud into a low-level, self-hosted systems language capable of building
 operating systems and low-level graphical software.
